Introduction 
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The core idea of this package is to simplify the use of Python packages so that with the shortest number 
of lines, users can easily produce useable scripts.

This package is designed to support the use of **ODPS** service.

In addition to that, the package also include simple and useful Classes to interact with the two most popular 
databases, **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**. 

Some other Classes include:

- **ChatBot** is used to support the connection to Dingtalk allowing user to easily send messages to group chat 
  using Custom ChatBot service. 

- **Mailer** can allow users to send email by using SMTP settings. Files such as Excel, CSV or images are supported
  as well, just need a bit of separation to assure. 

- **OneDriver** have some potentials to grow as users can now interect with OneDrive and SharePoint with just a few 
  simple lines of code, but it still have some serious issues on getting starting Token, so it is still not yet 
  suitable for new Python users.
